# ☁️ Cloud Computing + AWS CLI Setup (Hands-On)

A simple, beginner-friendly guide that explains cloud concepts with real screenshots — and shows how I connected my AWS CLI to the cloud from scratch.

📌 What’s Inside:
- Cloud vs On-Prem: What’s the real difference?
- SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS (Explained in 1 line each)
- AWS Regions, AZs, Edge Locations — simplified
- Step-by-step AWS CLI setup (with screenshots)
- Successfully ran: `aws iam list-users`

📷 All steps are backed by real terminal outputs & IAM screenshots — no fluff, just proof

If you’re starting out with cloud, this will save you hours of confusion.
