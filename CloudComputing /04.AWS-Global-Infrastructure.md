## Where does all this cloud computing Works?

- 69 Availability Zones
- 22 Geographic Regions
- Way more Edge Locations!

More than 190 countries!!

## REGIONS: 
- Physical locations in the world.
- Geographically  distinct location which has multiple datacenters (AZs).
- Each region physically isolated and independent of every other region in terms of location, power , water supply
- Each region has atleast 2 AZs.
- AWS largest region is US-EAST.
- New services get first available in US-EAST.


## AVAILABILITY ZONES: 
- One or more discrete data centers.
- An AZ is a data center owned and operated by AWS in which AWS services run.
- Represented by Region-code, followed by a letter identifier eg. us-east-1a.
- Multi-AZ distributing your instances across multiple AZs allows failover configuration for handling requests when one goes down.
- <10ms latency between AZs.


## EDGE LOCATIONS:
- data centers owned by a trusted partener of AWS.
- These locations serve request for cloud front and Route53. Request goes either of these services will be routed to nearest edge locations automatically.
- S3 transfer Acceleration traffic and API gateway endpoint traffic also use the AWS Edge Network.
- This allows latency no matter where the end user is geographically located.


## GovCloud (US):
- AWS GovCloud regions allow customers to host sensitive Controlled Unclassified infromation and other types of regulated workloads.
- GovCloud regions are only operated by employees who are U.S citizens, on U.S. Soil.
- They are only accessible to US entitiesand root account holders who pass a screening process.
